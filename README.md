Train Schedule App

[Check it out here!](https://barroncn.github.io/TrainSchedule/)

This app allows users to add a train route to a database that will keep track of the train's schedule and display it along with the schedules for trains other users have entered. Each time the page loads a current schedule is shown, with time of the next train and accurate minutes until arrival. Firebase is used to store the data so it can be shared accross multiple users and stored permanently.
